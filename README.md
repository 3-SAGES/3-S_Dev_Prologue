# Dev_Prologue 📖

> **"Where the story begins. A peaceful space dedicated to the foundational chapters of my development journey."**

## 🍃 The Philosophy
Unlike a "junkyard" of broken code, this repository is a curated collection of **completed** efforts. It represents the groundwork of my skills. Every folder here signifies a concept learned, a challenge overcome, and a step taken from beginner to developer.
